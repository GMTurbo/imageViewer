A Three.js Image viewer application.  I stole this from here (http://skookumx.com/webgl/finale/) and modified it to work with any image.

You need to enable the chrome flag: -disable-web-security in order for this to work.

for mac:
	open terminal and type: open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args -disable-web-security

for pc:
	edit chrome shortcut to have -disable-web-security
	
	
if you're ok loading "unsafe scripts", you can try it out [here](
